```

## Ex3 - Turn off devices after 5 min if motion sensors are off from 2 min
_"motion%d"_ refers to all devices named motion1, motion2, motion3...
```lua

```

## Ex4 - If a switch is turned on, do something

```lua
dzbasic
on dz_switchon
  print "Hello world"
endon
```

## Ex5 - Create custom events
These events are updated every minute and are visible from everywhere:
```lua
dzbasic
event ev_outdoor1 when %%temperature%% < 10 or %%temperature%% > 30
event ev_outdoor2 when %%temperature%% < 5, time = "7:00-9:00"
event ev_outdoor3 when %%sensorhum#humidity%% > 50
```

## Ex6 - Be notified if a custom event is on for a number of minutes
Reuse of ev_outdoor1 event declared in Ex5
```lua
dzbasic
on ev_outdoor1 duration >= 300 -- 5min
  notification "Outdoor temp alert", FREQUENCY = 60, QUIET = "22:00-08:00", SUBSYSTEMS = "PROWL"
endon
```

## Ex7 - Be notified if device is on since 5 min or more

-- update the temperature value of a sensor
update "21", "my_temp_sensor"
-- update values of a temp/hum sensor
update "21,50,0", "my_temp_hum_sensor"
-- update the level of a selector
update "Level", "my_selector"
```

## Ex12 - Change the icon of the device

```lua
dzbasic
icon 110
```

## Ex13 - Display the day of the week as an icon
We assume that the values 100 to 700 correspond to the icon number in Domoticz.
```lua
dzbasic
on time "at 00:00"
  $ICONS = 100,200,300,400,500,600,700
  icon $ICONS[@date("%w")+1]

    switch off, checkfirst
  else
    switch on, checkfirst
  endif
endon
```

or
